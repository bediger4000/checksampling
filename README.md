# Test Central Limit Theorem

From [Statistics Libre Text](https://stats.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_Statistics/Introductory_Statistics_(Shafer_and_Zhang)/06%3A_Sampling_Distributions/6.02%3A_The_Sampling_Distribution_of_the_Sample_Mean):

> For samples of size 30 or more, the sample mean is approximately
> normally distributed, with mean 
> &mu;<sub>X</sub> = &mu;
> and standard deviation &sigma;<<sub>X</sub> = &sigma;/&#8730;n
> where n is the sample size.
> The larger the sample size, the better the approximation.

The above is a pretty typical assertion in statistics texts.
The derivation must be a doozy,
because there's rarely a discussion of the Central Limit Theory.
